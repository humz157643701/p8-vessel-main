*Make a nice illustration that illustrates sub-d connector connections and board to board connector
*Make temperature sensor files, using ADC
*Make updated revison of PCB
*Make LLI able to send messages, i.e. with the odd sensor data
*Maybe use uint8_t data[] and sizeof() in combinaiton for package() to avoid the length parameter

\paragraph{Background}
The background for the formation control subject of this project
originate in a collaboration with Port of Aalborg, who has a vision to
make their harbour an intelligent harbour. This will, among other
things, include autonomous piloting of cargo ships bringing cargo to and from
Aalborg. For the cargo ships to enter the harbour it is important that
the seabed is deep enough and the sand has not build up larger bars or
moved the channel unexpectedly.  Currently bathymetry surveys are
performed manually with a small manned survey boat equipped with a
multi beam sonar, scanning some area of interest, which is a smaller
fraction of the whole Limfjord.

This is done with a period between three months up to three years,
depending on how active the seabed is. If the level is too shallow,
such that the cargo ships cannot enter, it is the Port of Aalborg that
needs to clear the area and ensure safe travel for their customers.

The work within this project is carried out to assist the Port of
Aalborg with their survey task. The development and implementation of
the AAUSHIP project will fit very well into this environment and be of
good aid for the Port of Aalborg.

The first focus point of the project is to model and test the
prototype of the AAUSHIP and then extend the fleet with duplicates of
the first AAUSHIP. The ship needs to follow a trajectory and thereby
sail within a predetermined location of interest. The second focus
point is to implement formation control of a fleet of AAUSHIP's and
test this at the location of interest. An area of the harbour has been
given as a use case to test the results against.

\paragraph{Method}
The AAUSHIP is modelled by a 5 degree of freedom (DOF) model, which differs
from a 3 DOF model by including the pitch and roll also.
These are taken into account due to the fact that the AAUSHIP runs
with single beam sonars and therefore it is important to know the
relative pitch and roll angles. The model is designed from the inertia matrix and the masses of the AAUSHIP, it includes the damping which is linearised at the operating velocity both in surge and sway, the restoring forces that brings the vessel to steady state when pitching and rolling and lastly the input forces from the actuators mounted at the vessel. This results in a satisfying model with 5 DOF, which suits the purpose of the project.
%The model of the AAUSHIP is designed to be
%\begin{align}
%M_{RB} \dot \nu_r + D(\nu_r)\nu_r + g(\eta_r) = \tau_{RB} + \tau
%\end{align}
%where $M_{RB}$ is the rigid body matrix, $D(\nu_r)\nu_r$ is the
%damping matrix which depends in the velocities and $g(\eta_r)$ which
%is the restoring forces acting on the vessel. The forces on the right
%hand side of the equation is the rigid body forces and the input
%forces from the actuators.

From this model a simulation environment is created, such that
development on other parts of the project is easily tested.  Different
estimators have been implemented in the system to estimate the states
needed in the model. This includes a Attitude and Heading Reference
System and a Kalman Filter. Both filters are used to estimate the
heading of the AAUSHIP, and the Kalman Filter is used to the main
states estimates. The model is implemented with Robot Operating System
(ROS) and a simulation feature is available within both ROS and Matlab.

%As for now shows the simulation that the model of the AAUSHIP are able
%to follow a predetermined trajectory with a mean error of 32cm and a
%maximum error of 87cm. This is within the accepted limit when looking
%at the area of interest. When then AAUSHIPs needs to sail in
%formation, and cover rather large areas, then is the accuracy not very
%important, at least not such small derivations.

The result of the project is expected to be a complete
survey of a bounded area from the use case given by the Port of
Aalborg. This is used in a comparison with data measured from the Port
of Aalborg to verify the AAUSHIP survey system, as this will end up
being. This map needs to be measured by two or three autonomous
vessels that sails in a predetermined formation that is currently being investigated with respect to the area of interest. From this will three different candidates for formation strategies be analysed, implemented and tested to verify the most promising result of the task resulting in a formation that optimises the scanning process for the Port of Aalborg.

%The formation approach still needs to be chosen. Work on testing three %different candidate strategies is the goal. 
 
\paragraph{Conclusion}
The model and simulation has proved to work when implemented on the AAUSHIP which results in a vessel that tracks a predetermined trajectory. This makes the basis for the further work of expanding the fleet of AAUSHIPS and implement the investigated control strategies and ending up with a successful digital mapping of the seabed in the Limfjord.

%For now the first aim is reached with a model of the AAUSHIP that can
%track the given trajectory, implementation of the whole ship is close
%to done, it just needs testing. Moving on the focus is to determine
%the control paradigms within formation control that fits with our
%use case and implement this on AAUSHIP and the rest of the fleet.

%As the complete
%conclusion should the tests be performed in the same location of
%interest as the data have been taken by the Port of Aalborg. The
%conclusion should by that time be that the fleet can do it as good as
%the manual scanning performed by The Port of Aalborg.

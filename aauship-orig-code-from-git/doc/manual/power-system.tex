\section{Power System}

The power source in AAUSHIP is chosen to be LiPo batteries, which is
a type of battery chemistry where the operator take great care in not damaging
the batteries. If care is not taken they might catch on fire, which
cannot easily be extinguished. This can of course be dangerous.

\subsection{Power Harness}
The power system on the ship consists of some somewhat convoluted
wiring harnessed loosely in the hull structures. An single line
diagram is therefor provided to give an overview of the system. This
se seen on the figure~\vref{fig:sld}, where the most basic elements
are presented. The CP is the charge port, used to recharge the
batteries. It is also seen that it contains six battieres connected in
two banks, see section~\vref{ssc:lipo}.

The power hub is just a pair of screw terminals as a means of
connecting different devices to, on there there is also connected some
regulators already, which provides 3.3 and 5.0 V for the auxiliary
devices shown in green, which are connected through USB to the
\ac{HLI}. Also the communication in the form of a Wi-Fi access point is
powered from a separate DC supply.

\subsection{LiPo Basics}
\label{ssc:lipo}
The LiPo battery packs each consists of four cells in series, which in
the LiPo battery world is called ``4S1P''. One parallel is what you get
when you only have a series connection.

Since each cell is normally not charged individually but across the
output terminals of the battery, every pack with more than one series
cell is equipped with a so called balance port. This is basically a
smaller multiple pin connector that has a connection to each cell,
such that is is possible for a ``balancer'' to discharge cells that is
unbalanced. An unbalanced cell is basically just a cell that does not
have the same voltage as the others.

This balancer is usually run whilst one is charging the main
connections. The purpose is to eliminate the difference that is
inherent in each cell not being exactly the same, such that one cell
does not get overcharged, when charging them in series.

\subsection{LiPo Battery Safety}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colback=yellow!75!,colframe=red]
It is strongly advised not to mess with the LiPo batteries before you
have read and understand how to handle them. A good resource for
learning some basics and safety about LiPo batteries are
\citep{tjintech:lipo-basics} and \citep{tjintech:lipo-safety}.

\section{Objective}

%\head{This section describes what can be done for humanity by the use of
%automation in the realm of Aalborg.}

A use case that is a basis of this project is a service that surveying
companies offer, which is to survey and map the seabed of waterways and
lakes. Currently they do this very manually my sailing with a boat in
the lake after a \ac{GNSS} in the boat. In waterways as small rivers
and the like in Denmark they do it by a smaller boat or raft, where
they are using a prism system and a stick to take point measurements
of the river.

These tasks could be automated and probably improve surveying time by
using an autonomous system that can cover this. Here focus is on
trying to design such a system with small ships sailing in formation
to scan a predefined area.

%This will then lead to defining the needed capabilities for
%the formation control.

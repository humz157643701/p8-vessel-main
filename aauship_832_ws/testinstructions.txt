////// To do step tests

	Modify lqr_controller_node.cpp 

			Comment out the callback in where the reference is received
			Initialize the reference to the desired step values

	Catkin_make

	Run sensors.launch
	Run kalman_filters.launch
	Run inner_controller_final.launch or something like that.

////// To do a path test
	
	Modify wps.txt to have the desired waypoints
    To extract the Waypoints: 
          rostopic echo /kf_statesnew

	Modify lqr_controller_node.cpp

		Uncomment the reference callback so the reference updates
		Initialize the references to zero in both outputs

	Catkin_make 

	Run sensors.launch
	Run kalman_filters.launch -> This should also include the path_follower_node
	Run path_controller_model_test.launch -> Runs the inner controller and records the important topics
		
////// How to extract the data

	Remember the nice bag files by changing its name when a good test has finished.

	To know which topics are in the file
		rosbag info bagfile.bag

	To extract topics
		rostopic echo -b bagfile.bag -p -topic > testname_topic.txt //The name for the txt file is recommended

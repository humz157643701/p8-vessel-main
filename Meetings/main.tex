\section*{Supervisor Meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 24th of May 2017}

\subsection{Status}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 
    \item 
    \item 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We can sail forward.
    \item When putting F and -F in the motor it should turn on the spot, but with high forces it goes backwards.
    \item Maybe the motor dynamics are the problem, but we are not sure which test to try.
    \item The speed and yaw controllers don't work together.
    \item We should have the test in an appendix even though the result are not good and explain why they do not work.
    \item We can look at the test with /150 and see why it works compared to our gains.
    \item Explain the test in the result chapter and discuss them.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Part II Comments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item How have we tuned the filters? 
    \item Start by making the gyro look nice, the position.
    \item Write about the tunning of the filter.
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The boat has sailed before.
    \item No need for correction sheet, we just need to know the errors and the corrections. Maybe present the solution in the presentation if there is any big mistake.
\end{itemize}

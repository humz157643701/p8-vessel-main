\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 22th of February of 2017}
\subsection{Comments on the model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item If you rotate slow and drive slow - off diagonal elements in the damping matrix are not that relevant. The same happens with the Coriolis-Centripetal matrix. We should just state clear that we are aware of them and why we do not consider them. 
	\item Although the off-diagonal elements might be bigger, they occur in axes with low speeds.
	\item How to interpret the Coriolis effect: It is related to rigid body movement. An object will always rotate around the axis with most inertia or the axes with least inertia. Anything in the middle makes it swing because the object wants to rotate in one of the other axes so the rotation is "unstable". 
	\item Ideally the boat inertia is symmetric so nothing happens but practically there is some imbalance due to mass distribution. As the speeds are low, we can ignore the Coriolis effect.
	\item Added mass: We should take it into account but maybe at low speeds it is not important. We need confirmation of this fact.
\end{itemize}	
\subsection{GPS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The variation of the GPS is large, but maybe it needs more time. It could also be that it was just beside the building, that could be the problem. Specially when the building is south of the boat.
	\item If you have raw data, you also get the precision on the estimation, so you could vary your weights in the Kalman filter according to that confidence.
	\item We could also get an RTK GPS.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Batteries}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Simon order charging cables because we could not find them.
	\item Batteries: Simon had some but they have less that half the capacity, they may not be enough for a final test. 
	\item We will order some new batteries.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Comments on the document}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It is a good idea to note what the rotation matrices do: Including b and n in the notation, for example.
	\item Put references for the rotation convention and to the use of the NED frame.
	\item Does the force of the propellers affect the y body axis?
	\item Normally for references you use [p17,1] in the references, rather than referencing the same book several times.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Make a plan with milestones.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Supervisor Meeting\\ \small Friday, 05th of May 2017}

\subsection{Status}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Boat up and running again.
    \item We can move the boat remotely through the internet.     
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Robust Section Comments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Remember to put the references in the form of numbers.
    \item Paragraph in page 28 is repeated.
    \item Monte Carlo simulations with disturbances and parameters variations could be a good idea to test the controllers. Run several step responses and check the behavior.
    \item Do the same simulations with the LQR and compare them.
    \item Check the inputs in both because they are also in the performance function.
    \item Maybe the LQR requires less energy and worse response but both fulfill their requirements.
\end{itemize}	
\subsection{Waypoint Section Comments}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The path is done by using straight lines between points, but we do not need to hit the points.
    \item It is a mixture between waypoints and path following, so explain the whole approach better.
    \item The path outside the area is not important.
    \item Show that the algorithm will always converge to the path mathematically.
    \item Prove or justify that the convergence of the distance to the path goes to 0.
    \item We could also prove that with constant disturbance there will be a constant offset.
    \item Plot of how much are we deviating from the line (the distance) and how it goes to 0.
\end{itemize}

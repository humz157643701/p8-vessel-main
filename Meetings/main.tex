\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 08th of March 2017}
\subsection{Status}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We have set up ROS for the initial tests.
	\item We have made the charger
	\item We did mostly research this week. On robust control and on trajectory generation.
\end{itemize}	
\subsection{Reducing the model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We can reduce the model if there are some states that we do not need.
	\item We also remove $\dot{y}_\mathrm{b}$ state as the model is to be used in control design.
	\item With non linear control we could actuate along the $y_\mathrm{b}$ axis by using the couplings from damping and Coriolis effects.
	\item A boat movement can be seen to be similar to that of a car. You can move sideways if you maneuver.
\end{itemize}	
\subsection{Controller for the low level}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The input is the heading and the speed and the output is the input to the motors.
	\item A drawing of all the control structure and how the different controllers interact could be a good idea.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Now the simple simulation is fixed. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{RTK-GPS}
\begin{itemize}
	\item We will know about the RTK GPS when Simon is back. Probably tomorrow.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Path Planning}
\begin{itemize}
	\item You have a simple predefined scenario, a straight line for example, and then you apply your controller. This way it is easy to evaluate the performance of the controller.
	\item We need to consider how to keep ourselves on the path, how to reach the path when we are not there, how to make a control that is good when turning, among others.
\end{itemize}

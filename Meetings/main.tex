\section*{Supervisor Meeting\\ \small Thursday, 18th of May 2017}

\subsection{Part I Comments}
\begin{itemize}
	\item To abbreviate "for example" use "i.e.".
    \item Diagram of system description should have processing units written, no control/computation.
    \item Both base and rover use the same satellites in RTK mode.
    \item The error in the verification test corresponds to the quantization in time of the measurements. If the speed was a tenth, the error will be less.
    \item Maybe include a tail on Part I at the end of the modeling chapter.
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The tests are in process, we are trying to find and correct the errors in the implementation.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maybe include an error plot of the step responses below each step response, with the 1-$sigma$ region as well.
    \item Mark when the turn starts and finish in the distance plots in the outer controller.
    \item Why the robust seems worse in the green area and with an overshoot in the outer controller? Maybe the outer needs a faster inner controller than the robust one
    \item Bandwidth of inner and outer controllers could be a good question.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Meeting}
Wednesday, 25th of May around 12

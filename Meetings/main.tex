\section*{Supervisor Meeting\\ \small Thursday, 11th of May 2017}

\subsection{Status}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Test force.
    \item Model verification.
    \item Planning to hand in the 26th of May.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Monte Carlo Simulations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Take one sample in time and calculate the sigma value.
    \item Plot nominal response $\pm$ sigma at each time.
    \item Maybe a zoom on the robust plot could help to see it more clear.
    \item A zoom on the distance could help to see the error better.
\end{itemize} 
\subsection{Writing Plan}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Part I should be done this week and Part II the next one.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The position is not that important for surveillance, as long as we know where we are to process the data afterwards.
    \item The argument could be to do it as precise as possible, just analyze the performance.
    \item Another argument could be that the more precise the control is, the less overlap in the measurements.
    \item For helicopter landing or streams you need to be precise in position but that is another control problem.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Misc}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Just leave the RTK base there for now.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Meeting}
Thursday, 18th of May at 14:00

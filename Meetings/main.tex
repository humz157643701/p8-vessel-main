\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 19th of April 2017}

\subsection{GPS Status}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We got the GPS base working and we walked on a line to test it. It follows $\pm$0.5 m.
    \item The GPS has some delays, around 3 seconds. Where the delay comes from we do not exactly know.
    \item If the data is at 5 Hz, the delay seems to be big. We think it is because we have done the forwarding in a quick way. 
    \item We thought that the packages may arrive unordered, but the TCP orders the packages for you. Besides, different routes are unlikely because there are only few hops.
    \item 3G connection may give around hundred miliseconds delay.
    \item Maybe we should find a standard package that can forward information between a serial port and a TCP port.
    \item We get a better signal using the antenna in the C1 building.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{USB Modem}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We do not have one right now.
    \item Jesper will look into it. 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Path following}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The boat can more or less follow a square.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Robust Control Simulation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The motors will not be able to do what they do in the simulations.
    \item We should look into why the control actions are like that.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Reading material}
\begin{itemize}
	\item How is the path generated. Explain it in the report.
	\item Functional requirements Storing the data is not the focus of our project. We could say that we store our sensor data for post-processing.
	\item Normally you verify the GPS by processing to find out what the actual position of the boat was. But we do not need to do it.
	\item We should show graphs of the results of the Kalman filter.
	\item The model for the magnetometer, we need to get either the model for the magnetic field of Aalborg or just project the components to get the direction.
	\item In Aalborg the magnetic field strength is $[16.5,0.7,47.7]^\mathrm{T}$. We should look into this.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We should plan to sail now. 
\end{itemize}

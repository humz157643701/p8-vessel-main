\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 22nd of March 2017}
\subsection{LQR Controller}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test the step independently on each variable, the dynamics are not the same when turning if you are stationary, with constant speed or accelerating.
    \item The motors have some dynamics that we could include in the simulation because they are fast but not instantaneous.
    \item A first order model should be sufficient for describing the motors.
    \item Maybe it is a good idea to do a test in water (step). Use a tachometer on the coupling inside the boat to read the speed.
    \item It could be interesting to change the limits in the motors, for example allowing only forward movement or with different maxima.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Kalman Filter Implementation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Maybe the estimator is not a Kalman filter in the implementation, Jesper will talk with Nick about it.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Path Following Algorithm}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Path following algorithm without taking wind into account gives an offset.
    \item The offset is corrected a bit measuring the real speed of the boat.
    \item Looking at the perpendicular distance in the path to the waypoint is good for going from one point to another.
    \item If you have a strict path you need to follow maybe it is a good idea to ensure that we pass through the waypoints.
    \item We could have a look at Helmsman's controller.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Exam Date}
\begin{itemize}
    \item 22nd or 23rd of June if possible. Jesper will find a censor and figure it out for next time.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Next Supervisor Meeting}

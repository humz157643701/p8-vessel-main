\section*{Supervisor meeting\\ \small Wednesday, 5th of April 2017}

\subsection{Status}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We are working on the GPS implementation, robust control and sensor fusion.
    \item We have also look at the use case and the design considerations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{RTK GPS}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It needs to be connection between the two GPS.
    \item We could use a 3G USB dongle.
    \item For the base location we need the exact location, we should do a long test (maybe two days).
    \item There used to be an antenna in the roof that we can use and then the module inside.
    \item Both GPSs need to have the same satellites inside.
    \item Accept all the satellites that the GPS can connect to at the beginning.
    \item We can also use one NTRIP as base station if there is one near available.
    \item There are ways to have more than one base stations: virtual base station.
    \item Figure out the best way to do it and then we will find how to do it.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Robust Control}
\begin{itemize}
    \item We have done a first mdoel for Hinf design.
    \item We need to think to what the controller should be robust to, for example model uncertainties (added mass, aerodynamics).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Miscellaneous}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Send status by email with some documentation and some questions if we have them. If need it we can also agree on a Skype meeting.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Next Supervisor Meeting}
